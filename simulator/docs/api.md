## Watch the simulator's resources

Watch individual changes to all k8s resources in the simulator. This endpoint uses `Server-Sent Events`.
Once this API is called, the server will be continuously sending WatchEvent every time the event happens.

### HTTP Request

`GET /api/v1/listwatchresources`

#### Parameter
You can specify the `lastResourceVersion` of each resource, which can be retrieved using the `list` API of each resource.
If you won't specify it, this API calls the `list` and returns the result as "ADDED" Events before starting watch.  

We recommend to call the `list` API before the calling and to use `XXXlastResourceVersion` parameters.

The `ResourceVersion` must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server.
See also [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions).
