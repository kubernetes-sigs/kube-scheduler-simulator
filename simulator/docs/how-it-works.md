## How the simulator works

This page describes how the simulator works.

### 0. starts the simulator.

The simulator server works with the following:
- scheduler
- [HTTP server](api.md) 

In advance, the simulator needs to launch etcd, controller-manager and kube-apiserver outside.
We recommend using [KWOK](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok), see [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) to know how we wire things up.

### 1. users request creating resource.

Users can create resources by communicating with kube-apiserver of KWOK via any clients (e.g. kubectl, k8s client library or [Web UI](../../web))

### 2. the scheduler schedules a new pod.

When a new pod is created through kube-apiserver, the scheduler starts scheduling.

### 3. the results of score/filter plugins are recorded.

Normally, when score/filter plugins are called from scheduler, they will calculate the results and return results to the scheduler.
But, in the simulator, custom plugins, that behave as score/filter plugin but records result after calculation, are used in scheduler.

### 4. the scheduler binds the pod to a node.

The scheduler finally binds the pod to a node if succeeded, or move the pod back to queue if failed.

The result store will notice that the pod has been scheduled/marked as unscheduled by the scheduler and add the scheduling results to the pod's annotation.
