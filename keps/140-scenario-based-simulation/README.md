# KEP-140: Scenario-based simulation

## Summary

A new scenario-based simulation feature is introduced to kube-scheduler-simulator by new `Scenario` CRD.

## Motivation

Nowadays, the scheduler is extendable in the multiple ways:
- configure with [KubeSchedulerConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/scheduling/config/)
- add Plugins of [Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/)
- add [Extenders](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/5320deb4834c05ad9fb491dcd361f952727ece3e/keps/sig-scheduling/1819-scheduler-extender)
- etc...

But, unfortunately, not all expansions yield good results.
Those who customize the scheduler need to make sure their scheduler is working as expected, and doesn't have an unacceptably negative impact on the scheduling result or scheduling performance. And, usually, evaluating the scheduler is not so easy because there are many factors for the evaluation of the scheduler's ability.

The scenario-based simulation feature will be useful for those who customize the scheduler to evaluate their scheduler.

### Goals

Users can simulate their scheduler with some defined scenarios and can evaluate their scheduler with the result.

### Non-Goals

See the result of scenario-based simulation from Web UI. (may be implemented in the future, but out of scope of this proposal.)

## Proposal

### Implementation design details

#### The current simulator and proposal

The simulator was initially designed with a strong emphasis on Web UI. 
Then, thanks to so much contributions from everyone, we've expanded the simulator to be able to be used from other clients like kubectl, client-go, etc.

Now that simulators are no longer just for webUI, we need to think about how we can design scenario-based simulation to be easy to use from other clients as well.

Therefore, this kep proposes to define the scenario **as CRD**. All clients, including web UI, can use the scenario-based simulation feature by creating the Scenario resource.

#### Scenario CRD

The Scenario is a non-namespaced resource. 
This CRD will be applied to kube-apiserver started in kube-scheduler-simulator.

We may need to change etcd request-size limitation by --max-request-bytes since the scenario resource may be bigger than other normal resources.

#### supported scheduler in simulator

The goal of this KEP is to make schedulers that meet the all following criteria work with scenario:

1. schedule Pods by the conditions of k8s resources.
    - In other words, schedulers shouldn't schedule Pods by the conditions other than k8s resources.
    - For example, if the scheduler that schedules Pods by checking some metrics from external server, 
    the scenario controller cannot manage metrics value and the Scenario may yield different results for each run.
2. scheduler that doesn't creates/edits/deletes resource. (except preemption and binding)
    - Basically, no one other than scenario controller should create/edit/delete resources.
3. scheduler included in simulator. Or outside scheduler which is based on scheduler in [kubernetes/kubernetes repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/scheduler)
    - In other words, scheduler needs to have [`NextPod`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/867b5cc31b376c9f5d04cf9278112368b0337104/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go#L75) field and uses it for fetch Pod from queue, 
    because we want to replace it to make scenario work correctly. (see [# Required setup for scheduler](#required-setup-for-scheduler).)

#### Required setup for scheduler

Those who want to use outside scheduler need to do replace [`scheduler.NextPod`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/d14ba948ef63769e9767aebd5a08171832a1bbf6/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go#L73) with a function provided by us.

The function we provide will does:
- restart/stop scheduling (see [# How to stop scheduling loop](#How-to-stop-scheduling-loop))
- check which Pods are scheduled and judge if it can no longer schedule any more Pods. (see [# How scheduler detects "when it can no longer schedule any more Pods" at (4)](#How-scheduler-detects-"when-it-can-no-longer-schedule-any-more-Pods"-at-(4)))

Those who want to use scheduler included in simulator don't need to do anything for setup since we does this set up for users.

#### The concept "ScenarioStep"

ScenarioStep is:
- simply represented by numbers. like 1, 2, 3â€¦
- moved to next step **when it can no longer schedule any more Pods**.

Within a single step, the phase proceeds as follows:
1. run all scenario.Spec.Events defined for that step. (OperatingEvents)
2. finish (1) (OperatingEventsFinished)
3. the scheduler starts scheduling. (Scheduling)
4. the scheduler stops scheduling and changes scenario.Status.StepStatus.Phase to SchedulingFinished
   when it can no longer schedule any more Pods. (Scheduling -> SchedulingFinished)
5. update status.scenarioResult and move to next step. (StepFinished)

##### Why scheduler needs to restarts/stops scheduling loop?

To ensure that the results of the simulation do not vary significantly from run to run.

If we don't have "ScenarioStep" concept and when users want to define multiple operations for the same time, users expect them to run concurrently and them to be run at the same time. But, in practice it is difficult to run them at the same time, because the scheduler is constantly attempting to schedule.
For example, suppose a user has defined a scenario to create 1000 Nodes at the same time. Since it is strictly impossible to create 1000 Nodes at the same time, pending Pods will be scheduled to the Nodes created first. And depending on what order the Nodes were created, the results of the simulation may change.
To prevent this, the scheduler needs to be stopped scheduling until 1000 Nodes are created.

##### How to stop scheduling loop

If the scheduler is based on implementation of the current scheduler in kubernetes/kubernetes, 
we can prevent a scheduling queue from poping next Pods by overwriting [`Scheduler.NextPod`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/867b5cc31b376c9f5d04cf9278112368b0337104/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go#L75) function.

The override function basically behave like normal `NextPod`,
but checks the running Scenario's status.SchedulerStatus and decide to stop/restart scheduling.

##### How scheduler detects "when it can no longer schedule any more Pods" at (4)

The most schedulers try to schedule Pods one by one. 

The idea here is detecting "when it can no longer schedule any more Pods" **by recording Pods scheduler have tried to schedule**.

Basically, scheduler are checking other resources' status and decide the best Node for a Pod.
That means if any resource haven't created/edited/deleted, the scheduling result shouldn't be changed.

Resource creation/changes/deletion should be only run during `OperatingEvents` phase,
and only preemption(deleting Pod) or binding(scheduling Pod to a Node) happens during scheduling.

Thus, we can consider it can no longer schedule any more Pods when the following conditions are met:
1. all unscheduled Pods are tried to be scheduled twice or more.
2. no Pods are preempted and no Pods are scheduled during (1).

For example, there are Pod1 - Pod4 in the cluster and all of them aren't scheduled yet.
1. scheduler try to schedule Pod1 but cannot schedule it. Pod1 is moved back to queue.
2. scheduler try to schedule Pod2 and can schedule it.
3. scheduler try to schedule Pod3 and cannot schedule it. Pod3 is moved back to queue.
4. scheduler try to schedule Pod4 and cannot schedule it. Pod4 is moved back to queue.
5. scheduler try to schedule Pod1 and cannot schedule it. Pod1 is moved back to queue.
6. scheduler try to schedule Pod3 and cannot schedule it. Pod3 is moved back to queue.
7. scheduler try to schedule Pod4 and cannot schedule it. Pod4 is moved back to queue.
8. scheduler try to schedule Pod1 but cannot schedule it. Pod1 is moved back to queue.
9. during (3) - (8), no Pods are preempted, no Pods are scheduled, and Pod1,3,4 are tried to be scheduled twice.
So, we can consider it can no longer schedule any more Pods.

The reason why all unscheduled Pods are tried to be scheduled twice or more is that [binding cycle is run in parallel](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#scheduling-cycle-binding-cycle).

You will understand why it is necessary twice, after seeing the following case:
1. scheduler try to schedule Pod1 but cannot schedule it. Pod1 is moved back to queue.
2. scheduler try to schedule Pod2 and can schedule it.
3. scheduler try to schedule Pod3 and cannot schedule it. Pod3 is moved back to queue.
4. scheduler try to schedule Pod4 and cannot schedule it. Pod4 is moved back to queue.
5. scheduler try to schedule Pod1 and can schedule it. 

Note that we can only record what Pods scheduler are trying to schedule next in `NextPod`. 
That means we cannot see what Pods scheduler moves back to queue when cannot schedule Pods.

During (3) - (5), no Pods are preempted, and Pod1,3,4 are tried to be scheduled once. 
**But, Pod1 is scheduled at (5)**.

In `NextPod`, we may not realize the Pod1 is scheduled at (5), 
since the binding cycle is run in parallel and binding may just not be finished when NextPod is judging if it can no longer schedule any more Pods.

So, to make sure the all unscheduled Pods cannot be scheduled anymore, we need to see the all unscheduled Pods are tried to be scheduled twice or more in `NextPod`.

#### Adding events to running Scenario 

It is allowed to add events while the Scenario is running.

Note that it does not make sense to add past ScenarioStep events.
The scenario will continue to run until all events in .spec.Events are completed, and when all events are completed, the scenario will be "Paused" phase in the case .spec.Events doesn't have "Done" operation.

So, it is strongly recommended adding events to running Scenario only after Scenario have reached "Paused" phase. 
(since ScenarioStep has stopped moving forward in "Paused" phase as described above.)
Otherwise, you may add the past ScenarioStep events and they are ignored by running Scenario.

#### Configure when to update ScenarioResult

As described in the above, the controller only update status.scenarioResult in Scenario resource when proceeding to the next ScenarioStep.

This is because kube-apiserver will be so busy if the controller update status.scenarioResult everytime it updated,
especially when the size of Scenario is so big.

> etcd is designed to handle small key value pairs typical for metadata. Larger requests will work, but may increase the latency of other requests. By default, the maximum size of any request is 1.5 MiB. This limit is configurable through --max-request-bytes flag for etcd server.
https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/dev-guide/limit/#request-size-limit

And, sometimes, users may want to reduce this updating request more for some reasons. 

For example, 
- when watching Scenario for dynamic event addition 
- when using Scenario for accurate benchmark testing, users may want to reduce the request to update Scenario for kube-apiserver as much as possible

We can add a new configuration environment variable `UPDATE_SCENARIO_RESULTS_STRATEGY` and define some strategy like:
- `UPDATE_SCENARIO_RESULTS_STRATEGY=AtMovingNextStep`: default value. update status.scenarioResult in Scenario resource when proceeding to the next ScenarioStep.
- `UPDATE_SCENARIO_RESULTS_STRATEGY=OnPause`: update status.scenarioResult in Scenario resource when the Scenario's phase becomes `Paused`, `Succeeded` or `Failed`.
- `UPDATE_SCENARIO_RESULTS_STRATEGY=OnDone`: update status.scenarioResult in Scenario resource when the Scenario's phase becomes `Succeeded` or `Failed`.

#### The result calculation packages

ScenarioResult only has the simple data that represent what was happened during the scenario.

So, we will provide useful functions and data structures to analyze the result. 

For example:
- the function to aggregate changes in allocation rate of the entire cluster.
- the function to aggregate changes in resource utilization for each Node.
- the function to aggregate data by Pod.
- the generic iterator function that users can aggregate custom values.
- (Do you have any other idea? Tell us!)

By putting only the minimum simple information in ScenarioResult and providing functions to change it into a user-friendly structs, many data structures can be supported in the future without any changes to API.

#### The case kube-apiserver have Scenarios when the controller start to run

When the controller is started and finds the Scenario which phase is "Running", the controller just changes the status "Failed" with updating the `.status.message` like "the controller restarted while the Scenario was running".

In the future, it would be nice if we could implement the endpoint in simulator that tells the Scenario controller that the simulator is going to be shuted down. 

#### Prohibitions and Restrictions

When Scenario is created, the scenario is started by the controller. The scenario is run one by one, and multiple scenarios are never run at the same time. 
This means the controller will run the next Scenario after the current running Scenario becomes "Failed" or "Succeeded".

In addition, the following actions are prohibited during scenario execution The scenario result will be unstable or invalid if any of these actions are performed.
- change the scheduler configuration via simulator API.
- create/delete/edit any resources.

And all resources created before starting a scenario are deleted at the start of the scenario,
so that they don't affect the simulation results.

### User Stories 

#### Story 1

The company has added many features into scheduler via some custom plugins, 
and they want to make sure that their expansions are working as expected and has not negatively impacted the scheduling results.

##### Solution

They can define appropriate scenario and analize the results.

#### Story 2

The users want to see how their customized scheduler behaves in the worst case scenario.

##### Solution

Even when a scenario is running, users can add events to that scenario. 
So, in this case, they can add events that are most worst case for the scheduler by looking at the simulation results and the resources status at that point.

## Questions/Answers

### Can you elaborate a bit more on which schedulers will be supported?

Respondent: @sanposhiho.

The current simulator has scheduler internally.
(see [simulator/docs/how-it-works.md](simulator/docs/how-it-works.md))

And the scheduler version can be used is only fixed one. (v1.22 at the time I write this.)
That Scheduler can be customized by adding your plugin to scheduler or by scheduler configuration.
(see [docs/how-to-use-custom-plugins](./docs/how-to-use-custom-plugins))

So, that means the current simulator can simulate scheduling with only limited scheduler.

And, for who want to use scheduler not supported by simulator, (e.g. scheduler of different versions, scheduler applied some patches, or completely original scheduler)
we plan to support "outside scheduler" in simulator. ([issue here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-simulator/issues/182))

The outside scheduler literally means the scheduler outside of simulator,
communicates with the api-server in simulator and schedule all the Pod.

Given the current simulator only supports limited scheduler described above,
I _guess_ more users will want to use outside scheduler rather than scheduler in simulator.

Any kinds of scheduler can be created in this world.
But, the goal of this KEP is to support only schedulers listed in [# supported scheduler in simulator](#supported-scheduler-in-simulator) in scenario.

However, we believe we can provide a function to make most schedulers work with scenario in the future,
(although we won't go into much detail in this KEP.)

That schedulers only needs to satisfy the condition that it schedule Pods one by one with same process,
and users only need to put the provided function into the top of the process to make scheduler work with scenario like:

```go
// this scheduler trys to schedule Pods one by one.
func (s *scheduler) run() {
	for {
	    scheduleOne(pod)	
    }
}

// scheduleOne schedule a given Pod.
func (s *scheduler) scheduleOne(pod *v1.Pod) {
    // fetch one pod and try to schedule it.
    pod := s.fetchPodFromSomewhere()
	
	// user only need to put this function provided by us so that make this scheduler work with scenario.
	functionProvidedByUs(pod)
	
    // scheduling implementation
}
```

But, even with this function, I think we cannot support the scheduler that doesn't meet the criteria (1)(2) in [# supported scheduler in simulator](#supported-scheduler-in-simulator).
